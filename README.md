## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In doing this project I got a ton of practice with javascript and CSS. One of the biggest new things I learned was how to retrive data from a .json file. This involved learning and working with fetch(), Promises, await, and .json(), all of which were new to me. Another new approach I got more comfortable with was the practice of creating a class in CSS such as .visible, and having js simply toggle that class on and off when appropriate. This was my refactored approach to each of the quiz screens and through the CSS I was able to delegate .visible's activities via media queries.

```js
async function getQuiz(type) {
    const response = await fetch('./data.json');
    const data = await response.json();
    for (const quiz of data.quizzes) {
        if (quiz.title == type) {
            quizChosen = quiz;
            totalQuestions = quizChosen.questions.length;
            document.querySelector(".question-total").textContent = totalQuestions
            increment = (1 / totalQuestions) * 100;
        }
    }
    makeQuestions(quizChosen)
}
```

### Continued development

I think it will be fun to continue working on this assignment as an on going project. For the future, I plan to add difficulty levels with different sets of questions. The program already allows for a variable number of questions.

### Useful resources

- [fetch with json](https://dmitripavlutin.com/fetch-with-json/) - This helped me understand how to use await, fetch, and .json()
